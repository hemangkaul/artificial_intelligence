neural networks
- neurons are connected to and receive electrical signals from other neurons
- neurons process input signals and can be activated

mathematical model for learning inspired by biological neural networks
artificial neural networks
- model mathematical function from inputs to outputs based on the structure and parameters of the network
- allows for learning the network''s parameters based on data

(x1, x2) -> is it going to rain
h(x1, x2) = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2
need some threshold / activation function
e.g. some g(), step function, logistic sigmoid e^x / e^x + 1, rectified linear unit
h(x1, x2) = g(w0 + w1x1 + w2x2)

How to train neural networks:
gradient descent
- algorithm for minimizing loss when training a neural network
- start with a random choice of weights
- Repeat
    - calculate the gradient based on all data points: direction that will lead to decreasing loss
    - update weights according to the gradient
stochastic gradient descent calculates based on one data point
mini batch gradient descent calculates based on on small batch of data

Peceptron
- only capable of learning linearly seprable decision boundary

Multilayer neural network
- artifical neural network with an input layer, an output layer, and at least one hidden layer

backpropagation
- algorithm for training neural networks with hidden layers

Start witha random choice of weights
Repeat
    - calculate error for output layer
    - for each layer, starting with output layer, and moving inwards towards earliest hidden layer
        - propagate error back one layer
        - update weights

deep neural networks
- neural network with multiple hidden layers

overfitting
dropout
-temporarily removing units -- selected at random -- from a neural network to prevent over-reliance on certain units

TensorFlow
playground.tensorflow.org

computer vision
-computational methods for analyzing and understanding digital images

image convolution
applying a filter that adds each pixel value of an image to its neighbors, weighted according to a kernel matrix

pooling
- reducing the size of an input by sampling from regions in the input

max-pooling
- pooling by choosing the maximum value in each region

convolutional neural network
-neural networks that use convolution, usually for analyzing images

feed forward neural network
-neural network that has connoections only in one direction
input -> network -> output

recurrent neural network

long short term memory
